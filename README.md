### Description 
Deepdreamer-ai was a part of a react js practice project. I faced problems in managing state and passing data throughout the components. So I used context API to keep the data flow clean. Calling the api and watching JavaScript handling asynchronous jobs was an interesting part. 
For the first time I implemented React Router to my project. But at the end when I went to deploy the app in vercel I saw a problem while refreshing the page. It shows error 404 page. I also fixed that in `vercel.json` file by defining a fallback URL.
